# Gorgo
<small>The vertasile multi-threaded password sprayer built on the shoulders of giants.</small>
---
Gorgo is a fast and option-rich password sprayer for traditional network protocols. Gorgo multi-threads Medusa to distribute spraying in a way that Medusa cannot do out of the box. 

For example, Gorgo can generate username:password permutations ahead of time so that you can adjust the order by hand if needed. This file can also be split for distributed scanning such as use with [axiom](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom).

## Why?
I built Gorgo because I wasn't a fan of the current tools that are out there for password spraying 'dumb' protocols in a smart way. I wanted to change that.
